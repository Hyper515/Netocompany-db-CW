To add a new user to a public GitHub repository so that they can commit, you can follow these steps:

    Navigate to the repository on GitHub
    Click on the "Settings" tab on the right-hand side of the repository
    Click on "Manage access" in the left-hand menu
    Click on the "Invite a collaborator" button on the right-hand side
    Enter the username or email address of the user you want to add
    Click on the "Add [username/email address]" button
    GitHub will send an email to the user inviting them to collaborate on the repository
    Once they accept the invitation, they will have the ability to commit changes to the repository

Note: To add a user as a collaborator, you need to have the appropriate permissions to do so. If you are not the owner of the repository, you may need to request that the owner add the user as a collaborator.
